Published online on November 15, 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present new branch-free algorithms for floating-point arithmetic at double, triple, or quadruple the native machine precision. These algorithms are the fastest known by at least an order of magnitude and are conjectured to be optimal, not only in an asymptotic sense, but in their exact FLOP count and circuit depth. Unlike previous algorithms, which either use complex branching logic or are only correct on specific classes of inputs, our algorithms have computer-verified proofs of correctness for all floating-point inputs within machine overflow and underflow thresholds. Compared to state-of-the-art multiprecision libraries, our algorithms achieve up to 11.7× the peak performance of QD, 34.4× over CAMPARY, 35.6× over MPFR, and 41.4× over FLINT.</p>

Published online on November 15, 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present KDRSolvers, a novel framework for representing sparse linear systems and implementing Krylov subspace methods on modern heterogeneous supercomputers. KDRSolvers uses dependent partitioning to uniformly represent sparse matrix storage formats as abstract maps between a matrix’s domain, range, and set of nonzero entries. This abstraction enables KDRSolvers to define universal co-partitioning operators for matrices and vectors independent of underlying storage formats, allowing changes in data partitioning strategies to automatically propagate through an application with no code modification. KDRSolvers also introduces multi-operator systems in which matrix and vector data can be ingested and processed in multiple non-contiguous pieces without data movement. Our implementation of KDRSolvers, targeting the Legion runtime system, achieves greater flexibility and competitive performance compared to PETSc and Trilinos. In experiments with up to 1,024 GPUs on the Lassen supercomputer, our implementation achieves up to a 9.6% reduction in execution time per iteration.</p>

Published online on July 23, 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Floating-point accumulation networks (FPANs) are key building blocks used in many floating-point algorithms, including compensated summation and double-double arithmetic. FPANs are notoriously difficult to analyze, and algorithms using FPANs are often published without rigorous correctness proofs. In fact, on at least one occasion, a published error bound for a widely used FPAN was later found to be incorrect. In this paper, we present an automatic procedure that produces computer-verified proofs of several FPAN correctness properties, including error bounds that are tight to the nearest bit. Our approach is underpinned by a novel floating-point abstraction that models the sign, exponent, and number of leading and trailing zeros and ones in the mantissa of each number flowing through an FPAN. We also present a new FPAN for double-double addition that is faster and more accurate than the previous best known algorithm.</p>

<em><strong>NSDI 2024 Outstanding Paper Award and Community Award Winner!</strong></em><br>
Published online in April 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In response to concerns about protocol ossification and privacy,
post-TCP transport protocols such as QUIC and Web-RTC include end-to-end
encryption and authentication at the transport layer. This makes their packets
opaque to middleboxes, freeing the transport protocol to evolve but preventing
some in-network innovations and performance improvements. This paper describes
sidekick protocols: an approach to in-network assistance for opaque transport
protocols where in-network intermediaries help endpoints by sending information
adjacent to the underlying connection, which remains opaque and unmodified on
the wire.</p>
<p>A key technical challenge is how the sidekick connection can efficiently refer
to ranges of packets of the underlying connection without the ability to
observe cleartext sequence numbers. We present a mathematical tool called a
quACK that concisely represents a selective acknowledgment of opaque packets,
without access to cleartext sequence numbers.</p>
<p>In real-world and emulation-based evaluations, the sidekick improved
performance in several scenarios: early retransmission over lossy Wi-Fi paths,
proxy acknowledgments to save energy, and a path-aware congestion-control
mechanism we call PACUBIC that emulates a “split” connection.</p>

<p><em><strong>An explicit 16-stage Runge–Kutta method of order 10 discovered by numerical search</strong></em><br>
David K. Zhang<br>
<em><strong>Numerical Algorithms</strong></em>, volume 96, pages 1243–1267<br>

Published online on March 1, 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This article presents the discovery of an explicit 16-stage
Runge–-Kutta method that numerically satisfies the Runge-–Kutta order
conditions (in Butcher form) to 10th order, conjecturally improving the
best-known number of stages in an explicit 10th-order Runge-–Kutta method from
17 to 16. Unlike the vast majority of published Runge-–Kutta methods, the
method presented in this paper was not constructed via symbolic analysis or the
use of simplifying assumptions, but instead by directly applying numerical
optimization and root-finding algorithms to the order conditions. A naïve
implementation of these algorithms would be made computationally infeasible
by the considerable size and complex structure of the Butcher equations.
However, we present a collection of software optimizations that greatly
accelerate the evaluation of the Butcher equations and their derivatives while
mitigating the effects of destructive cancellation, pushing these techniques
within the realm of feasibility. While we do not have a formal proof of order,
we present the results of numerical experiments to demonstrate that our method
satisfies the Butcher equations to an accuracy of over 3000 decimal digits.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sidecar: in-network performance enhancements in the age of paranoid transport protocols</strong></em><br>
Gina Yuan, David K. Zhang, Matthew Sotoudeh, Michael Welzl, and Keith Winstein<br>

Published online on November 14, 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In response to ossification and privacy concerns, post-TCP
transport protocols such as QUIC are designed to be “paranoid”—opaque to
meddling middleboxes by encrypting and authenticating the header and
payload—making it impossible for Performance-Enhancing Proxies (PEPs) to
provide the same assistance as before. We propose a research agenda towards an
alternate approach to PEPs, creating a sidecar protocol that is loosely-coupled
to the unchanged and opaque, underlying transport protocol. The key technical
challenge to sidecar protocols is how to usefully refer to the packets of the
underlying connection without ossification. We have made progress on this
problem by creating a tool we call a quACK (quick ACK), a concise
representation of a multiset of numbers that can be used to efficiently decode
the randomly-encrypted packet contents a sidecar has received. We implement the
quACK and discuss how to achieve several applications with this approach:
alternate congestion control, ACK reduction, and PEP-to-PEP retransmission
across a lossy subpath.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Constructive election control considers the problem of an
adversary who seeks to sway the outcome of an electoral process in order to
ensure that their favored candidate wins. We consider the computational problem
of constructive election control via issue selection. In this problem, a part
decides which political issues to focus on to ensure victory for the favored
candidate. We also consider a variation in which the goal is to maximize the
number of voters supporting the favored candidate. We present strong negative
results, showing, for example, that the latter problem is inapproximable for
any constant factor. On the positive side, we show that when issues are
binary, the problem becomes tractable in several cases, and admits a
2-approximation in the two-candidate case. Finally, we develop integer
programming and heuristic methods for these problems.</p>

<p><em><strong>Discovering New Runge–Kutta Methods Using Unstructured Numerical Search</strong></em><br>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Runge–Kutta methods are a popular class of numerical methods for
solving ordinary differential equations. Every Runge–Kutta method is
characterized by two basic parameters: its order, which measures the accuracy
of the solution it produces, and its number of stages, which measures the
amount of computational work it requires. The primary goal in constructing
Runge–Kutta methods is to maximize order using a minimum number of stages.
However, high-order Runge–Kutta methods are difficult to construct because
their parameters must satisfy an exponentially large system of polynomial
equations. This paper presents the first known 10<sup>th</sup>-order
Runge–Kutta method with only 16 stages, breaking a 40-year standing record for
the number of stages required to achieve 10<sup>th</sup>-order accuracy. It
also discusses the tools and techniques that enabled the discovery of this
method using a straightforward numerical search.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) is used to show that the
effective mass model correctly estimates the binding energies of excitons and
trions but fails to predict the experimental binding energy of the biexciton.
Using high-accuracy variational calculations, it is demonstrated that the
biexciton binding energy in transition metal dichalcogenides is smaller than the
trion binding energy, contradicting experimental findings. It is also shown that
the biexciton has bound excited states and that the binding energy of the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L=0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">L</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">0</span></span></span></span>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recently, experimental measurements and theoretical modeling have
been in a disagreement concerning the binding energy of biexctions in transition
metal dichalcogenides. While theory predicts a smaller binding energy (∼20 meV)
that is, as logically expected, lower than that of the trion, experiment finds
values much larger (∼60 meV), actually exceeding those for the trion. In this
work, we show that there exists an excited state of the biexciton which yields
binding energies that match well with experimental findings and thus gives a
plausible explanation for the apparent discrepancy. Furthermore, it is shown
that the electron-hole correlation functions of the ground state biexciton and
trion are remarkably similar, possibly explaining why a distinct signature of
ground state biexcitons would not have been noticed experimentally.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Traditionally, linear multistep methods (LMMs) for the numerical
solution of initial value problems, such as Adams methods and backward
differentiation formulas, have been derived through the use of polynomial
interpolation and collocation through continuous schemes. While these methods
can be implemented in modern computer algebra systems, they require the use of
highly expensive operations such as symbolic matrix inversion. This imposes a
severe limit on the complexity of LMMs that can be derived. In this
presentation, we present a generalized algorithm for deriving LMMs based upon
Taylor series expansion. By our approach, we show that the derivation of a LMM

including hundreds or thousands of terms. Furthermore, we show that this
algorithm is trivially generalizable to methods including arbitrarily many
off-grid points, and that it can be generalized to create LMMs for directly
solving initial value problems of arbitrarily high order, with the inclusion of
all intermediate derivative terms. Specific methods are stated and tested
numerically on well-known problems given in the literature.</p>
